## 2. Ingestion & Content Normalization

### Endnote Relocation Pass
EPUB backmatter citations (`notes.xhtml#n1`) are severed when splitting by chapter. The ingestion script resolves internal reference targets, extracts the citation text, inlines it as a standard Markdown footnote definition at the bottom of the corresponding chapter (`[^1]: Citation text`), and updates the in-text link to `[^1]`.

### Paragraph Anchor Tagging
Every top-level paragraph in chapter Markdown files receives a deterministic anchor:
`Market segmentation is the bedrock of targeted positioning. ^p-042`
Anchors follow the format `^p-[0-9]{3,}` and are preserved across re-indexes.

### Hierarchical Spine Contract (_meta.json)
The manifest models multi-level books (Parts -> Chapters -> Sections) with word counts, paths, and anchors.

## 3. Storage Separation & Synchronization

- **Vault (`vault/`):** Human-readable plain-text Markdown files and images. Can be edited externally (Obsidian, Neovim, VS Code).
- **Ephemeral Cache (`index.db`):** Stored strictly in the OS application data folder (`%APPDATA%\book-engine\`). Never checked into version control.

### Highlight Stability (W3C Text Quote Selector)
Highlights store `exact`, `prefix`, and `suffix` context fields alongside paragraph anchors to survive external edits.

## 4. Zero-Hallucination Practice Architecture

1. **Salience Scorer:** Ranks sentences based on glossary matches, bold formatting, definitional syntax, and summary sections.
2. **Deterministic Cloze Engine:** Masks proper nouns, cataloged glossary terms, or bold phrases. Answers are exact string slices.
3. **Scrambled Argument Reordering:** Randomizes sequential clauses or list items for manual reassembly.
4. **FSRS Scheduling:** Review intervals calculated locally via the Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler algorithm in SQLite.
